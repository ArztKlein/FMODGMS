A GameMaker: Studio and GameMaker Studio 2 extension that provides GML bindings to the FMOD Studio low-level API. Compatible with Windows, and Linux games.

Stable: 0.8.0 - FMOD Studio 1.09.01 - Windows, Linux
Beta: 0.8.1 - FMOD Studio 1.09.01 - Windows

NOTE: This extension only works with GameMaker Studio 2 if you export your game as an executable and run it outside of GMS2 . For some reason, it does not work properly if the game is run within GMS2 itself (i.e. during testing).
Features

    - Load and play a wide variety of audio formats not natively supported by GameMaker:Studio (e.g. MP3, MIDI, MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.).
    - Add custom loop points to sounds. This allows, for example, a music track to have an intro section that can seamlessly transition into an infinitely looping main section without having to break them up into two separate files.
    - Dynamically change to volume, playback frequency and relative pitch of a sound.
    - Analyze an audio stream using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and obtain its spectrum data.
    - Support for DSP effects such as flange, reverb and filters.
    - Extract tag information from audio files (e.g. ID3 tags from MP3s and Vorbis tags from OGGs).
    - Supports various audio output modes (e.g. ASIO, WASAPI, ALSA).
